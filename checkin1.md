Week 1 Check-Up

1. What we have accomplished:

- added parsing functionality and display for stories during the game
- added most logic for playing a round line-by-line and a whole game
- added input text box for user and check for correct input
- modified css to create workable display for round phase on computer (not mobile)
- added html/css for displaying post game results
- added logic for the lobby.html page
- worked on the relationship between the index.html and lobby.html

2. What challenges we encountered:

- figuring out the points at which the front-end js needs to connect to the back-end
- building procedurally generated html pages with js
- creating a button that will immediately direct you to the next page
- how to be pass an entered value to another page (then learned it in class)

3. Goals for next week:

- Choose a back-end server implementation (Heroku, flask, etc.) and start tieing it in
- Incorporate Google geometry to find distances and mongodb for storing players before match
- (Building off last point) Initializing geolocation function in lobby.html to find other players (show each found player in loading box)
- Spitting out sentences at a time for players to type (need to know when each player has finished typing one sentence)
