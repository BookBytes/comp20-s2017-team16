My dad is creative with how he escapes certain conversations. When I was a kid, my dad always used to tell me about his college days. He told me that him and my uncle would often buy tickets from scalpers to get into concerts. They were into 80s music ranging from alternative rock to big-haired shredder rock. (40 seconds)

Uncle Ryan and my dad were visiting their old alma mater, and, while visiting their old favorite restaurant "Moes", they were approached by scalpers. "Hey you wanna go see a Kevin Rudolf concert?" the scalpers asked. My pops replied with a his trademark "uhh, fo sho". (45 seconds)

My dad and his 56 year old brother went to the Kevin Rudolf concert, despite not knowing any of his music. The mixture of rock and rap was new to them, but they were embracing the new music. Then, they told me, something magical happened. Late 2000s rapper Lil' Wayne slowly descended from the ceiling and started his guitar solo in their song "Let It Rock."

Dood dood doo dood do dodo dood dee dee dood dee doodee deed do doo, played Lil' Wayne. The heartfelt sound of his two note guitar solo rang throughout the concert hall. Deed dee dee doooo ded dooodo deed dood doo dee dood doood deee dee do dood. I've always loathed this story. It just ends with my dad playing air guitar, and walking out of the room. Bravo dad, bravo.
