The internet is a pretty cool place because friends can gather together without being physcially close to each other. They can video chat, share music, send memes and gifs, and most importantly compete against each other in games of skill. The most important aspect of these games is that these online games dictate who, among the group, has the best evolutionary fitness.

Those with low evolutionary fitness would be worse at games than the winner. You must have some scientific explaination as to why some people win and some do not. Because those with low fitness can no longer keep up, in say a game of speed typing, they would have a lower words per minute. This is not opinion this is fact. You do not want to be less evolutionarily fit than your friends do you? What's taking you so long?!?! Dont you like punctuation!!?!

Become the m3m3l0rd, and spam the ever loving you-know-what out of your friends. Play mind games, talk trash, any measures you can take to out-compete your friends must be taken. If the youtube comments on my eighth grade spanish project have taught me anything, it is this: there are no friends on the internet. There exist only those who win at m3m3l0rd and those who lose. It is the modern day hunger games, and you will win.

Oh goodness, your friends are probably catching up to you. Cant handle the intensity of this game? You understand the stakes by now but what can you do? Spam them! Spam! The only thing more satisfying than spamming your friends with memes will be to watch the tears roll down their face after losing this typing game. 

It's a race to the end. Only a few more lines to go. You hope for easy words and then this comes p h w eu x lw jeif al "NOO" you think to yourself. Where even is are the keys for p q z m?! Oh, did you hear that? That sounds like someone is going to win. Is it you?
