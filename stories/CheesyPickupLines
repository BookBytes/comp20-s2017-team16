Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears! I'm not a photographer, but I can picture me and you together. Are you an interior decorator? Because when I saw you, the entire room became beautiful. Are you religious? Because you're the answer to all my prayers. Are you a camera? Because every time I look at you, I smile.

Did you sit in a pile of sugar? Cause you have a pretty sweet ass. Do you have a Band-Aid? Because I just scraped my knee falling for you. Do you know what my shirt is made of? Boyfriend material. If I were a stop light, I'd turn red everytime you passed by, just so I could stare at you a bit longer. I wanna live in your socks so I can be with you every step of the way. 

If you were a vegetable you'd be a cute-cumber. I seem to have lost my phone number. Can I have yours? Is your daddy a Baker? Because you've got some nice buns! Do you have a name or can I just call you mine? Do you like science, because I think we have chemistry. Are you a ballpoint pen because you're extra fine. Do you have a map? I'm getting lost in your eyes. 

Are you a parking ticket? Because you've got fine written all over you. Can I have directions? [To where?] To your heart. I'm not drunk, I'm just intoxicated by YOU. My doctor says I'm lacking Vitamin U. Have you been to the doctor laterly? Cause I think you're lacking some Vitamin Me.
