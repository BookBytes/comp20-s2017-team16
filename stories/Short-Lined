Wow, I'm going to tell you now you have entered a hyper competative-themed game.

This is the one with lots of rounds but not a lot of text.

Who among you is going to react the quickest?

Side note: I really like special characters % & * ^# %. 

Did that last line get you? Cool thing about me is, I also really happen to like all numbers.

I especially like $ % ^ @ # $ 7. Actually, now that I think about it, seven is the only number I really like. 

You don't have much information of how your friends are doing compared to you, do you? Does that make you anxious? 

Do you think you are winning?

Ask yourself: am I winning? Just thinking about probability if you all have an equal chance of winning, you are probably losing. Dont lose or your friends will make fun of you. 

Last line!!!! j fei  wji fl ow jqj slp eij l aaaannnndddd I'm done.
